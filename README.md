This is useful especially for ultrawide monitors.

```

## Usage

Once installed, make sure the script is selected in the "Kwin Scripts" settings panel and restat your KDE/Plasma session.
You should now see a set of keyboard shortcuts in the "Kwin" Global Shortcuts panel.
Set them to what you'd like and apply!
